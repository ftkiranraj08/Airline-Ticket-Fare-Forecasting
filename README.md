# Airline-Ticket-Fare-Forecasting
## Overview
This project focuses on forecasting airline ticket fares using machine learning models. The objective is to predict future ticket prices based on historical data, allowing airlines and travelers to better understand fare trends. By improving forecasting accuracy, we aim to provide valuable insights for pricing strategies.

# Project Highlights
Team Size: 4
# Duration: March 2023 - May 2023
Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Random Forest, Linear Regression
Data Source: A dataset containing historical ticket prices and related features.
Performance Improvement: The forecasting accuracy improved from 78% to 86% by transitioning from Linear Regression to Random Forest.
# Features
Ticket Price Prediction: Predict the price of airline tickets based on various features like departure and arrival dates, route, class, and 
more.
Random Forest Algorithm: Used for better prediction accuracy compared to traditional Linear Regression.
Visualization: Graphical representation of the historical data and forecasted prices.
